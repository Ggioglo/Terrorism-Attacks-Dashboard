# Terrorist Attacks Dashboard

This repository presents a Tableau dashboard created to analyze the evolution and impact of terrorist attacks by the five most active groups.  
The dashboard provides a clear and accessible way to explore how the number of attacks, their severity, and their distribution across time and space have changed.  

At the top, the dashboard highlights the key performance indicators: total attacks, deaths, injuries, and success rate. These metrics offer an immediate understanding of the scale and outcomes of terrorist activity and can be filtered by time period or target type.  

The temporal trends of attacks are shown in an area chart, where each color represents a different group. This allows us to observe how strategies have shifted over the years and which targets have become more or less prominent.  

Geographic patterns are illustrated through an interactive world map. Each point corresponds to an attack, with its size and color indicating the severity in terms of fatalities. This makes it easy to identify hotspots and understand the geographical concentration of incidents.  

Finally, a percentage bar chart compares how the different groups distribute their attacks across various target types, making it possible to directly contrast their strategic choices.  

For this repository, the dashboard is shared in PDF format with static screenshots. Although the interactive features cannot be experienced here, the PDF gives a comprehensive overview of the design, structure, and insights generated by the project.
